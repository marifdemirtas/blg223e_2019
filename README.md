# blg223e_2019
Codes I wrote for the homeworks of BLG223E - Data Structures, semester of Fall 2019.

Codes here can contain minimal errors and possible memory leaks, since the programs were said to be small enough to ignore such issues.

Every folder also includes the pdf prepared by our teaching assistants at ITU. HW2 also includes a test file written in calico, read more at https://calico.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
